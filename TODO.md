- graphs should be scrollable and by default have smaller x axis. Maybe also zoomable, or then we should have buttons. timeframe length could be a button like it is in nightscout
- it would be nice for charts to scale y axis
- it would be nice if panning any chart would pan every chart
- buttons for changing chart x pan
- It would be nice to know the current value of chart (in chart footer maybe?)
